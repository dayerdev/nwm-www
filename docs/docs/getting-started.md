## 1. Recommended Hardware
To join you will need a small, cheap, **Long Range** radio that will join into the mesh. We recommend the following starter devices:

| Device | Use Case | Approx Price |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Heltec V3** | Best starter node (USB powered) | £20 |
| **RAK WisBlock** | Best for Solar/Outdoor nodes | £40 |
| **T-Beam** | Great for GPS tracking | £35 |

## 2. Assemble your device
Once you receive your device, you will probably need to assemble it. If you don't, continue to Part 3.
